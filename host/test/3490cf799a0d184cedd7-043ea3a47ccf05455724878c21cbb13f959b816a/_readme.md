# How to MITM with a chrome extension

* Download these files and update them
* goto chrome://extensions and drag the parent folder holding these files into the window (you may need to turn chrome extension developer mode on)
* goto website and watch the magic.

For some extra awesomeness replace a javascript file with a js file from dropbox with ?dl=1 at the end of the js url. Now you can modify the file locally, it will update itself, and you just have to refresh the browser. Pretty cool!
